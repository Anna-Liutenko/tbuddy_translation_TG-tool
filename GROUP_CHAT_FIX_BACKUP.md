# Group Chat Message Handling Fix - Implementation Backup
# Created: 2025-09-06
# 
# This file contains backup of the original group chat filtering logic 
# from app.py lines 468-481 before implementing the fix

# ORIGINAL PROBLEMATIC CODE (lines 468-481):
"""
    # For group chats, only respond to messages that start with bot commands or mention the bot
    if chat_type in ['group', 'supergroup']:
        # Get bot info to check for mentions
        bot_username = None  # We could get this from getMe API call if needed
        
        # Only process if it's a command or if the bot is mentioned
        if not (text.startswith('/') or (bot_username and f'@{bot_username}' in text)):
            # In groups, ignore regular messages unless they're commands
            app.logger.info("Ignoring non-command message in group chat %s", chat_id)
            return jsonify(success=True)
        
        # Remove bot mention if present
        if bot_username and f'@{bot_username}' in text:
            text = text.replace(f'@{bot_username}', '').strip()
"""

# ANALYSIS:
# - This code blocks ALL non-command messages in group chats
# - bot_username is hardcoded to None, so @mention logic never works
# - Translation functionality is completely disabled in group chats
# - Only /start and /reset commands are processed

# ISSUE IMPACT:
# - Bot appears broken in group chats for regular messages
# - No typing indicators for regular messages
# - Translation feature completely unavailable
# - Inconsistent behavior between private and group chats

# ROLLBACK INSTRUCTIONS:
# To restore original behavior, replace the modified group chat logic 
# in app.py with the code block above
